The program is similar with cat, it read all the file followed by the dog and print on the terminal, if the argument is - then if will read the input from keyboard and print it on terminal. But it doesn’t handle the flag in cat, like -n…

./dog file1 file2 file3 …. or ./dog - file1 file2 …

ERROR:
[file doesn’t exist]                                  if the file followed by the argument doesn’t exist
