to running the code your argemnet have to be the host name space port number
example; ./httpserver localhost 8888

you can add -N or -l flag to set the number of thread you want to creat or name of log file

if the -N is not provided: N = 4

my program can't handle big file send and read.

my server not necessary print everything it did on the screen, but it will print the file header for sure.
